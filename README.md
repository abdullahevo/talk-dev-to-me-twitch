## Talk DEV to me

Talk DEV to me is a monthly show on [twitch.tv/aws](twitch.tv/aws) hosted by [Tiago Barbosa](https://github.com/t1agob) and [Alex Melnyk](https://github.com/am29d), where we invite customers, partners, or Amazon staff to have a chat about architecture, tools, best practices and code when developing on AWS. This repository contains all the relevant information on previous sessions with specific code examples. Because we banned PowerPoint slides from the show, most of the content will be either code or markdown ☝️.

> ⚠️ If you have ideas, topics or suggestions for future episodes, feel free to open an issue, we are happy to follow up and discuss it with you. Also, feel free to drop us any feedback what we can improve.
